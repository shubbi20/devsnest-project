     </em>on any dayfrom May 3 to MAY 04. As we know that coding is now the basic skills that everyone
      should have,so to inspire or aware the upcoming students,we should organize a coding camp in our
      college where students can learn cs fundamentals and coding , so in future they get a decent job.
